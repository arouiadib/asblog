# AsBlog : Blog module for PrestaShop 1.7 under construction

The module is not compatible with 1.6 and for early versions of 1.7. It is written with Symfony philosophy in mind, thus it uses modern controllers, dependency injection, grid component, form types, twig, new translation system, doctrine and modern design.

In front end, assets are build using NodeJs.
