# AsBlog : Blog module for PrestaShop 1.7 under construction

The module is not compatible with 1.6 and for early versions of 1.7. It is written with Symfony, thus it uses modern controllers, dependency injection, grid component, form types, twig, and new translation system and modern design.

In front end, assets are build using NodeJs.
